My last year-end summary was at the end of [2023(click here to visit)](https://www.oybdooo.top/post/my2023/). For 2024, I only post this travel [video(click here to visit)](https://www.oybdooo.top/post/my2024/).

Well, my 2025 start in a "ill mode". I was going on my trip from Leeds - Peterborough - Ely - Rochester - Canterbury - Dover - London. I lived on the sofa in my friend(Yuxuan)'s home. Maybe because of the turbid air on London underground, I felt ill and come to 2025 unconsciously.

After saying goodbye to Leeds, the city that I love & hate, and my groupmate at John's group. I came back to Shenyang, my hometown. Only for several days, I come to Japan.

In Japan, I visited Sendai, Morioka, Hiraizumi, Tokyo(only Narita Airport & train station...). I also met alot of friends from other countries. I spent the Chinese New Year with my friends (it is my first time that I did not spend Chinese New Year with my family). Well, I also gain a "r*ship" that ended without a clear conclusion...

I remembered that I came back to USTC and entered Jihua's group after a few days at home. It's abit weird when I came back, everthing seems familar yet unfamiliar to me. I lived in a hotel for the first few days. I changed my work status from "undergradutate" to "graduate" student. However, I didn't think I have made great progress at that time. For Astrobiology/Geochem/..., I need to fill in alot, cz my undergrad was sooo lazy :( 

At March, I met David. It's my first time to communicate deeply with Astrobiologist. I gained a general understanding on habitability, origin of life, etc. From then on, I admit that I really love such field (more than Space Physics :) ). We traveled to Beijing, Nanjing, Huangshan, and Shanghai. Alot of happy memories were made.

I attend two meeting in March & April. The "Youth Planetary Science Forum" & "International Conference for Deep Space Sciences"(mayb I forgot the name). Every time I attend such meeting, I felt very lack of confidence, because I have seen the gap between me and talented students from all over the country. Scientific research is not as easy I thought before. 

At the Spring, one emotional burden is very hard for me to resolve. I am a PhD student in USTC, not Caltech, UCLA, Oxford, Cam, ... or even UTDallas, UoLeeds. I am a PhD student in a Chinese University, not abroad. It made me feel inferior. I gained a low GPA(3.13/4.3) at Undergrad, so I always felt regret about why I didn't work hard at that time. (ToB honest, I haven't already solved the burden now yet, but I just worked hard to make up the pity.) 

With such burden, I came to Tibet, a place which is named for solve everyone's emotional burden. I first came to Chengdu for several days, and then visit Nyingchi, Qamdo, I climbed on the glacier. The scenery was reeally shocking. Then I came to Lhasa, visited different temples, and pray accord the Barkhor Street during Saga Dawa Month. Some people said that u can find Buddha in Tibet, I'd like to say I find myself in Tibet.

After finished the thesis & debate in June, it's time to say goodbye to my undergrad classmates(? Im not quite familiar with), and the undergrad Boding Ouyang. My undergrad had alot "crooked road", I once missed myself, but just as [this](https://www.oybdooo.top/post/bs-graduation/) said I have seen a BIGGER WORLD, a BETTER ME.

Then I went to PKU for a Paleoclimate Summer School, only for three days. The most important thing during this trip was I revisit some of my senior(Guanlin, Guannan and Jiaxu) in high school/met before. They went on different road, but we all have a bright future. Back to Hefei, it was f**king July Summer day in the city. I felt really sad. But I rebuild my homepage that days, [https://www.oybdooo.top/](https://www.oybdooo.top/). Then, I came to PKU again for Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Summer School. GFD is a hard subject, I didnt know much about that before...... Everyday was torment for me, but I think I will understand one day.

I went back home for a short summer holiday. Then I came back to USTC and started my PhD! The first happy thing is that I got MY OWN WORKPLACE ("pig pen"). The course for Planetary Science PhD is more interesting than my undergrad's boring courses. For me, I am an "old" USTC student, just take an example, for the selective course "Atmospheric Chemistry", the first course is boring I just took my bag and left during the class, it is unbelievable when I am was an undergraduate:)

The academic atmosphere in North Building(where my pigpen is) is much more better than the South one I was before. I grew up alot in academic through communication. In November I went to PKU again and spent two weeks there, I love the Weiming/Unnamed Lake! Then I went to NSSC for ISSI-BJ conference.

Well, I am sitting in my office in USTC now. I dont know why I wanna to write my year-end summary in English this yr. I may have alot grammar mistakes but it doesnt matter. The biggest anxiety I have now is that I didnt have a single published paper...... but maybe I am anxiety sooo early. My research still faces some problems now, but I think I will overcome it(not sooo confident). For 2026, I wish ......(a secret)
