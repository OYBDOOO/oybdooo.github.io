## 1. Evolution of the Earth's atmosphere

- Venus & Mars: $\ce{CO2}$ (oxidized)

​	Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune: $\ce{CH4}$ (reduced)

- Earth's atmosphere is not in chemical equilibrium. $\ce{N2}, \ce{O2}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{N2O}, \ce{NH3}$ are much higher. why?

  biological process play dominantly

#### 1.1 The primitive atmosphere

- compare to Sun/cosmos, Earth atmosphere lack of $\ce{H}, \ce{He}, \ce{Ne}, \ce{Ar}, \dots$

  Earth atmosphere was generated by degassing(脱气) of volatile(挥发性) compounds of the original solid materials (secondary atmosphere)

- 

  - before the Earth's core formed: gas highly reducing ($\ce{H2}, \ce{CH4}, \ce{NH3}$)
  - after core formed: similar to effluents from current volcanic activity ($\ce{H2O}, \ce{CO2}, \ce{N2}$, small quantities of $\ce{H2}, \ce{CO}$ and sulfur compounds)

- more recent model: Earth's interior was initially hot (tremendous bombardment 大撞击)

  - due to this, Earth's core formed earlier, volcanic gas at 4.5Ga similar to present emissions (more oxidized)

- an atmosphere of steam during the period that Earth was accreting material

- accretionary phase ended -> Earth cooled -> steam produce the oceans

  - atmosphere $\ce{CO2},\ce{CO},\ce{N2}$ (~10bar, ~10bar, ~1bar)

- Earth continue to be bombarded（撞击） until 3.8Ga. provide $\ce{CO},\ce{NO}$

#### 1.2 Prebiotic atmosphere and the origins of life

- living cells present before 3.5Ga
- lab work: biologically important organic compounds (include amino acids) can form when $\ce{CH4},\ce{NH3},\ce{H2},\ce{H2O}$ irrated with UV and sparked
  - $\ce{CH4},\ce{NH3}$ may not present at 3.5Ga ago
  - even if released from volcanoes, $\ce{CH4},\ce{NH3}$ minor because of photolyzed
- early atmosphere dominated by $\ce{N2},\ce{CO2}$
- $\ce{CO2 +h\nu->CO + O},\ce{O + O + M -> O2 + M}$
  - $\ce{O}$ increased sharply at altitude above ~20km because of solar radiation
- surface $\ce{O2}$ very low ($<10^{-12}$ present atmospheric levels, PAL) due to reactions with $\ce{H2}$
- two key compounds for formation of life: $\ce{HCHO},\ce{HCN}$
  - $\ce{HCHO}$ could be formed by photochemical rxns
  - formation of $\ce{HCN}$ difficult -> theories: comets bring biological precursor molecules / origins of life in oceanic hydrothermal vents
